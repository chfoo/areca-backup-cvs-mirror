Areca is mainly developed in Java, but it also uses some native code to handle files' attributes (extended attributes, ACL ...). This native code is contained in the "libarecafs.so" library.
If you want to compile it for your system, run the "compile.sh" script and copy the library to "/usr/lib" or "/lib".

Areca checks on startup that the "libarecafs.so" library is compatible with your system. If it is not the case, it automatically switches to a more basic implementation that uses standard commands (such as "chmod", "chown") and only handles basic attributes (no ACL or extended attributes)

To ensure that Areca will use "libarecafs.so" (and not the default implementation), edit the "/etc/areca/fwk.properties" file and set the "filesystem.accessor.impl" to "com.myJava.file.metadata.posix.jni.JNIMetaDataAccessor" (the default value is "com.myJava.file.metadata.posix.basic.DefaultMetaDataAccessor")
On startup, Areca displays some information about the "filesystem accessor" which is used (you should see something like "Loading configured file metadata accessor : [com.myJava.file.metadata.posix.jni.JNIMetaDataAccessor]" in your log file or log tab)
